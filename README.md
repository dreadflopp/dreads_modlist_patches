# Dread's Modlist Patches

## How to use

Download the patches by pressing the *code* button and choose *Download zip*. Install using *Mod Organizer 2*. The fomod-installer will guide you through the installation. 

## Where is the guide

The actual guide can be found [here](https://dreadflopp.github.io/dreadsskyrimbuild/). A readme version of the guide is available on the guides repository, [here](https://github.com/dreadflopp/dreadsskyrimbuild).

## Why are the guide and the patches in two different repositories?

This repository used to be the home for both the patches and the guide. Since I decided to use Github Pages to build a prettier home for the guide, the size of the repository grew and started to get messy. To keep things tidy, I decided to split the guide and the patches into two different repositories.
